# Volders Frontend Challenge 

This repoitory contains the code files of the challenge.

## Getting Started

There are only html, css, and javascript which can be run on any server like apache. 

Just clone this repo to your server directory and then access it through browser.

## Validation Assumption

From the image provided I assumed to validate fields of name only. Both the fields are required and must contain at least two characters.

This view contains validations and also is responsive.
